# Book Reading Planner

### Code Institute Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development

## UX
User stories:
Helping to plan reading a book intentionally

### Strategy
Create a reading schedule for books, offering 2 tracks of information as an output:
- How long does it take to read the entire book by reading x pages or x chapters every x day(s)
- How many pages or chapters do I need to read per x day(s) to be finished by a certain date

### Scope
Initial Input from the user:
- Book title
- number of pages
- reading goal (date to finish or number of pages per read)

Have further options selectable such as:
- 7 weekdays to enable or disable
- What time the reading is happening
- how long a reading session normally is

Output: Calendar with the days marked when the reading needs to happen. The user has the following options how to proceed:
- generate a pdf with the schedule
- export to Google Calendar (main calendar)
- Save locally in the browser
